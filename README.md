# Hatta's portfolio 🤖✨  

![image](assets/readme-photo.jpg)

**Static portfolios are dead.**  
So I built [hattabd](https://hattabd.vercel.app).

Instead of making you scroll endlessly, my portfolio adapts to *you*.  
Ask a question — my AI avatar replies instantly.

## 👇 What can you ask?

- 🧠 **Tech recruiter?** Ask about my stack & results  
- 💻 **Dev?** Dive into my code & mindset  
- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 **Friend or family?** See what I've been working on

This is not a portfolio.  
It's a **conversation tailored to your curiosity**.

### Prerequisites

- **pnpm** package manager

- **GitHub token** (for GitHub integration features)
